For this coding demo we are using NLP to explore the recent literature on this topic with her lab. 1.2.1 About the data Working with Blaisdell Medical Library’s health librarian Amy Studer, we conducted a pilot systematic search in EMBASE and PubMed on this topic for articles published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Practical Radiation Oncology, and Lancet over the past 5 years. For this demo we are using the titles and abstracts from that search. (See the readME for more information regarding the search strategy used to generate our datatset.) 1.2.2 Why R? What is RStudio? “R” is a programming language and statistical software that interprets scripts. RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R. You need R installed in order to use RStudio, but you don’t need RStudio to work with R. So why R? Faciliates reproducible research workflows - integrates with other tools. - designed for data analysis - produces high-quality graphics It’s extensible and interdisciplinary - free, open-source, well-documented, and cross-platform - runs on Mac, PC and Linux. - works with data of all shapes and sizes. - large library of external packages available for performing diverse tasks, including text mining and NLP. - Large (and growing) community Should you use R? Maybe. Use whatever langauge allows you to perform your work and faciliates sharing with your direct colleagues and the broader reserach community.

EMR Clinical notes Medical journal literature Surveys and questionnaires Interviews Community forums Social media The goal is to take text data -&gt; convert it into data that can be analyzed (numbers) -&gt; run some analysis -&gt; interpret the analysis. 2.1 General Methods for Analyzing Text word frequency TF-IDF PCA tokenization KWIC: Key Word in Context co-occurence stemming lemmatization - removing inflectional endings to return the base dictionary form of a word (lemma). bigrams: conditional probability of a token given the preceding token. named entity recognition (NER): identifying which items in the text map to proper names (people, places, location). regular expressions (RegEx): searching for exact words, parts of words or phrases feature based linear classifiers topic modeling word embedding: mapping words or phrases to vectors of real numbers allowing words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. sentiment analysis: subjective information to determine “polarity” of a document. (e.g., positive or negative reviews) part of speech tagging: determining the parts of speech for each word in a sentence. 2.2 NLP NLP allows us to use “distance reading” to unlock information from narrative text for extraction and classification: keyword detection topic detection document summarizing document classification document clustering document similarity speech recognition text translation Natural Language Processing (NLP) = linguistics + computer science + information engineering + data science. We use NLP to computationally parse and analyze large amounts of natural language data. 2.3 What’s a Natural Language? “…any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.” Thanks, Wikipedia. Thought questions: Are clinical notes a natural language? What about tweets? 2.4 NLP Trends 1950s Alan Turing’s article on “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” 1960s Restricted vocabularies 1970s Conceptual ontologies and chatterbots 1980s First statistical machine translation systems developed (IBM, Watson) 2010s Extensions of classical NLP and emergence of deep neural networks In this workshop we’re focusing on classical NLP (feature engineering). 2.5 Caveats before we get started Garbage in, garbage out. Know your corpus. All models are wrong, but some are useful. And others are dangerous. Natural langauge data can not be deidentified. NLP models are powerful, but can fail when applied to jargon-heavy, niched domains. Augmenting with developed medical dictionaries helps, but parts of speech taggers, for example, are not designed for the health space. This is especially true for classical NLP techniques, although deep learning approaches hold strong promise for working with unstructured health data. 2.6 Further resources DataLab’s NLP Researcher Toolkit Curated list of ML and NLP resources for healthcare Post on how NLP can help clinicians Machine Learning for Healthcare August 2020 Conference at Duke Useful packages: ntlk (python) spaCy (python) quanteda (R) tidytext (R) Classes: Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning NLP youtube series CS 124 Slides on Text Processing Datasets: https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php?format=&amp;task=&amp;att=&amp;area=&amp;numAtt=&amp;numIns=&amp;type=text&amp;sort=nameUp&amp;view=table "],["working-with-text-data-in-r.html", "3 Working with Text Data in R 3.1 Setup 3.2 Preprocessing 3.3 The Bag of Words Representation 3.4 The Document Term Matrix 3.5 TF-IDF", " 3 Working with Text Data in R 3.1 Setup 3.1.1 Packages In R, and most programming languages, there are many packages - code written by other people to help with certain tasks. For this workshop we will be using two packages - ‘tm’ and ‘ggplot2’. The ‘tm’ - text mining - package has methods for mining text with R including importing data, storing corpora, applying operations on corpora (such as common preprocessing methods), and document term matrices. The ‘ggplot2’ package has functions related to plotting and visualizing data. Run this command if you don’t already have these packages installed. install.packages(&#39;tm&#39;) install.packages(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) install.packages(&#39;Matrix&#39;) Once the packages are installed, load them into your R environment. library(&#39;tm&#39;) library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) library(&#39;Matrix&#39;) You can find the documentation for the package online Within R/RStudio you can browse function documentation with the following syntax. ?TermDocumentMatrix 3.1.2 Data for this workshop For this workshop, we are looking at a set of abstracts of medical journal articles related to breast cancer. We have 714 abstracts, stored in a csv, with duplicates. We would like to get the key words from each abstract, as well as visualize / check for groupings of abstracts in two dimensions. data &lt;- read.csv(url(&quot;https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop-nlp-healthcare/abstracts.csv&quot;), stringsAsFactors=FALSE) head(data) ## authors year ## 1 2008 ## 2 2014 ## 3 2015 ## 4 2016 ## 5 2016 ## 6 2017 ## title ## 1 The UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) Trial B of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial. ## 2 Erratum: Effect of radiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary surgery on 10-year recurrence and 20-year breast cancer mortality: meta-analysis of individual patient data for 8135 women in 22 randomised trials (The Lancet (2014) 383(9935) (2127–2135)(S0140673614604888)(10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60488-8)). ## 3 Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology 57th Annual Meeting, ASTRO 2015. ## 4 Late-Breaking Abstracts from the 57th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology, ASTRO 2015. ## 5 Proceedings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology, ASTRO 2016. ## 6 2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting Late-Breaking Abstracts. ## journal ## 1 The Lancet ## 2 The Lancet ## 3 International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics ## 4 International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics ## 5 International Journal of Radiation Oncology ## 6 International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics ## text ## 1 Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation). We aimed to test the benefits of radiotherapy schedules using fraction sizes larger than 2·0 Gy in terms of local-regional tumour control, normal tissue responses, quality of life, and economic consequences in women prescribed post-operative radiotherapy. Methods: Between 1999 and 2001, 2215 women with early breast cancer (pT1-3a pN0-1 M0) at 23 centres in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks or 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2·67 Gy over 3 weeks. Women were eligible for the trial if they were aged over 18 years, did not have an immediate reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. Randomisation method was computer generated and was not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse, defined as reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779. Findings: 1105 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group and 1110 to the 40 Gy group. After a median follow up of 6·0 years (IQR 5·0-6·2) the rate of local-regional tumour relapse at 5 years was 2·2% (95% CI 1·3-3·1) in the 40 Gy group and 3·3% (95% CI 2·2 to 4·5) in the 50 Gy group, representing an absolute difference of -0·7% (95% CI -1·7% to 0·9%)-ie, the absolute difference in local-regional relapse could be up to 1·7% better and at most 1% worse after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Photographic and patient self-assessments indicated lower rates of late adverse effects after 40 Gy than after 50 Gy. Interpretation: A radiation schedule delivering 40 Gy in 15 fractions seems to offer rates of local-regional tumour relapse and late adverse effects at least as favourable as the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. ## 2 EBCTCG (Early Breast Cancer Trialists&#39; Collaborative Group).

Let’s look at the text from the first abstract data$text[[1]] ## [1] &quot;Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation).

For example, some words are capitalized, there is punctuation, weird symbols, and numbers. For many NLP methods, we want to normalize the texts to get around these issues. The ‘tm’ package has several built in features for normalizing text. The first step is to load the text into a ‘corpus’ object. 3.2 Preprocessing 3.2.1 Load the text column into a ‘corpus’ object mycorpus &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(data$text)) inspect(head(mycorpus)) ## &lt;&lt;SimpleCorpus&gt;&gt; ## Metadata: corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0 ## Content: documents: 6 ## ## [1] Background: The international standard radiotherapy schedule for early breast cancer delivers 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2·0 Gy over 5 weeks, but there is a long history of non-standard regimens delivering a lower total dose using fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation).

What can it do with a sequence of characters? In order for us to apply statistical methods on a document, we need a representation of texts that is easy for a computer to process, but still encodes information related to that text’s content. One such representation is the Bag of Words format. Bag of Words is a way of representing a document that encodes a document as a ‘bag’ of its tokens. The document is represented as the words that appeared in the document and the number of times those words appeared. All information about word order is lost in this representation, however, for many NLP methods, this is still an effective representation of the content of the document. bag of words image The power of the bag of words representation is that each document can be represented in the same vector space. We do so by defining the vector dimensions to reflect the vocabulary across all the documents. The vectors can then be merged into a matrix called a Document Term Matrix. dtm image 3.4 The Document Term Matrix In brief, a Document Term Matrix: - each document is represented by a set of tokens and their counts - the order of tokens is not encoded in this representation - the basis of many text processing methods, including document classification and topic modeling In R we can use a DocumentTermMatrix function from the ‘tm’ package to create this structure from our corpus. 3.4.1 Creating a Document Term Matrix from the corpus object From the ‘corpus’ object we can create a document term matrix. mydtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(mycorpus) Note: the DocumentTermMatrix automatically sets all the characters to lower case. 3.4.2 Exploring with a DTM A useful tool is the inspect function from the ‘tm’ package. inspect(mydtm) ## &lt;&lt;DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 714, terms: 8180)&gt;&gt; ## Non-/sparse entries: 85943/5754577 ## Sparsity : 99% ## Maximal term length: 40 ## Weighting : term frequency (tf) ## Sample : ## Terms ## Docs breast cancer dose patients radiation results therapy treated treatment ## 125 6 3 0 8 0 0 0 0 3 ## 18 6 0 4 4 0 1 1 4 1 ## 192 12 2 0 17 0 1 1 1 4 ## 203 14 29 0 2 6 1 3 4 0 ## 207 10 4 2 9 3 1 0 2 1 ## 272 7 4 7 7 1 2 1 0 1 ## 322 4 1 3 3 1 0 1 2 1 ## 323 6 1 11 4 1 0 1 1 8 ## 598 5 1 3 13 0 1 1 0 6 ## 622 6 6 0 13 1 1 2 0 4 ## Terms ## Docs years ## 125 2 ## 18 0 ## 192 3 ## 203 6 ## 207 5 ## 272 0 ## 322 0 ## 323 0 ## 598 5 ## 622 2 From this format it we can find word counts and document lengths. document_lengths &lt;- rowSums(as.matrix(mydtm)) word_counts &lt;- colSums(as.matrix(mydtm)) We can get a sorted list of the biggest documents. sorted_document_lengths &lt;- sort(document_lengths, decreasing=TRUE) barplot(sorted_document_lengths[1:10], col = &quot;tan&quot;, las = 2) Or a sorted list of words and their frequencies. sorted_word_counts &lt;- sort(word_counts, decreasing=TRUE) barplot(sorted_word_counts[1:10], col = &quot;tan&quot;, las = 2) 3.5 TF-IDF TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. It is a VERY popular method for finding documents relevant to a users search term. It can also be used as an effective (often times better than simple bag of words) representation of documents for statistical modeling of documents in a corpus. 3.5.1 Intuition behind TF-IDF TF-IDF combines two attributes that may signal a words importance in a document into a single metric. The first is the ‘term frequency (TF)’ - how often the word appeared within that document. It makes intuitive sense that if a word appears many times in a document, that the document is about something related to that term. The second attribute is the ‘inverse document frequency (IDF)’ - a measure of what proportion of the documents the word appeared in. If a word appears in all documents, its weight should be reduced. Conversely, if a word appears only in few documents, it should be highly weighted for those documents. 3.5.2 TF-IDF formula tfidf(t,d,D) = tf(t,d) * idf(t,D) Where, tf(t,d) is a function of a terms(t) frequency for a given document(d). And, idf(t,D) is the inverse function of a terms(t) appearance across all the documents(D). There are many variations of functions for tf(t,d) and idf(t,D) that can be used for computing TF-IDF. 3.5.3 TF-IDF from DTM Create tf-idf weighted DTM in R tfidf_dtm &lt;- weightTfIdf(mydtm, normalize=TRUE) Inspect the new dtm inspect(tfidf_dtm) ## &lt;&lt;DocumentTermMatrix (documents: 714, terms: 8180)&gt;&gt; ## Non-/sparse entries: 85943/5754577 ## Sparsity : 99% ## Maximal term length: 40 ## Weighting : term frequency - inverse document frequency (normalized) (tf-idf) ## Sample : ## Terms ## Docs apbi boost dose grade group local survival toxicity ## 121 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 16 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.032447894 0.01528079 ## 177 0 0 0.009260951 0 0 0.00000000 0.006907363 0.00000000 ## 291 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 294 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 307 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.01274054 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 443 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 54 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.011921597 0.00000000 ## 593 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## 7 0 0 0.000000000 0 0 0.00000000 0.000000000 0.00000000 ## Terms ## Docs women years ## 121 0 0 ## 16 0 0 ## 177 0 0 ## 291 0 0 ## 294 0 0 ## 307 0 0 ## 443 0 0 ## 54 0 0 ## 593 0 0 ## 7 0 0 Compare the tfidf representation with the tf representation for a single abstract tf_doc10 &lt;- as.matrix(mydtm[10,]) tf &lt;- colSums(tf_doc10) tfidf_doc10 &lt;- as.matrix(tfidf_dtm[10,]) tfidf &lt;- colSums(tfidf_doc10) barplot(sort(tf, decreasing=TRUE)[1:10], col = &quot;tan&quot;, las = 2) barplot(sort(tfidf, decreasing=TRUE)[1:10], col = &quot;tan&quot;, las = 2) "],["pca.html", "4 PCA", " 4 PCA 4.0.0.1 a. Intuition behind PCA The most straightforward way to visualize the information in the TF-IDF matrix is to plot its columns, but this is unsatisfactory because there are thousands of them, and each column is mostly zeroes (so contains little information): plot(as.matrix(tfidf_dtm[, 1:2])) Our answer is to use principal components analysis (PCA), which rotates the big matrix until we are “looking” down the “direction” (or component) with the most variability. The result is another matrix of equal size to the first, but each column contains information from all of the columns of the original matrix, and they are sorted so that the most important columns are first. We can observe get the most important relationships by focusing on just a few of these “principal components”. Let’s continue with our example: 4.0.0.2 b. Computing PCA articles &lt;- t(tfidf_dtm) mypca &lt;- prcomp(articles, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE) 4.0.0.3 c. Plotting the abstracts Add the principal components to the original data: plotdata &lt;- cbind(data, mypca$rotation) And now plot the abstracts. Each dot in the figure represents one abstract. ggplot(plotdata) + aes(x=PC1, y=PC2) + geom_point() Now let’s identify some articles from the plot. min_index &lt;- order(plotdata$PC1, decreasing=FALSE) max_index &lt;- order(plotdata$PC1, decreasing=TRUE) # view the most divergent titles: plotdata$title[min_index[1:6]] ## [1] &quot;Signal transduction pathways regulated by CSF-1 receptors modulate the in vitro radiosensitivity of mammary epithelial cells.&quot; ## [2] &quot;Creation of an episode-based payment model for prostate and breast cancer radiation therapy.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Erratum to: Wang SY, Kelly G, Gross C, et al.

These are the most characeristic terms from the abstract, as ranked by TF-IDF. We’ll plot the abstracts on the 2nd and 3rd principal components, annotated by the top terms. #source(url(&quot;https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop-nlp-healthcare/top_terms.R&quot;)) plotdata[[&#39;top_terms&#39;]] &lt;- top_terms(tfidf_dtm) ggplot(plotdata) + aes(x=PC2, y=PC3, label=top_terms) + geom_text(check_overlap=TRUE) We’re also going to look at k-means to identify clusters in data. To begin, let’s include some abstracts dealing with cervical cancer from the same journals as the breast cancer abstracts. cervical &lt;- read.csv(url(&quot;https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop-nlp-healthcare/cervical-abstracts.csv&quot;)) data[[&quot;topic&quot;]] &lt;- &quot;breast&quot; cervical[[&quot;topic&quot;]] &lt;- &quot;cervical&quot; combined &lt;- rbind(data, cervical) Rather than processing the combined abstracts step-by-step, let’s grab a function to replicate the processing we did on the breast cancer abstracts. This time, though, the terms “breast” “cervical”, and “cervix” will be removed prior to the analysis. #source(url(&quot;https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop-nlp-healthcare/get_corpus.R&quot;)) pca_combined &lt;- get_corpus(combined, remove=c(&quot;cervical&quot;, &quot;cervix&quot;, &quot;breast&quot;)) data_combined &lt;- cbind(combined, pca_combined$rotation) We now have a PCA of the combined abstracts, so let’s see how the first few components look: ggplot(data_combined) + aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=topic) + geom_point() ggplot(data_combined) + aes(x=PC2, y=PC3, color=topic) + geom_point() If we didn’t know the correct labels, we can let the computer pick them itself. One commonly-used method that’s built into R is k-means classification. K-means identifies clusters in data based on maximizing the similarity within groups while maximizing the dissimilarity between groups. It is often best to use PCA for dimension-reduction before applying PCA because separation between points increases with the square of the number of dimensions, and that separation makes clustering less effective. Here I will be quite aggressive and use only three principal components. km &lt;- kmeans(pca_combined$rotation[, 1:3], 2, iter.max=1e3, nstart=100) km_fit &lt;- fitted(km, method=&quot;classes&quot;) data_combined[[&quot;group_fit&quot;]] &lt;- as.factor(km_fit) ggplot(data_combined) + aes(x=PC2, y=PC3, color=group_fit) + geom_point() Another way to explore the result of k-means is to look at the articles that are most characteristic of each cluster. First, calculate the sum of squared residuals for each article. km_residual &lt;- pca_combined$rotation[, 1:3] - fitted(km) km_ss_residual &lt;- apply(km_residual, 1, var) data_combined[[&quot;err&quot;]] &lt;- km_ss_residual Now we can identify the articles within each group that have the smallest residuals. These are closest to the group center, and thus most characteristic of the group. data_ordered &lt;- data_combined[order(data_combined[[&quot;err&quot;]]),] head(data_ordered[[&quot;title&quot;]][data_ordered[[&quot;group_fit&quot;]] == 1]) ## [1] &quot;Analysis of the Financial Impact of the 2018 ASTRO Breast Dose-Fractionation Guidelines on Radiation Oncology Departmental Reimbursement.&quot; ## [2] &quot;Patterns of breast recurrence in a pilot study of brachytherapy confined to the lumpectomy site for early breast cancer with six years&#39; minimum follow-up.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Long-term radiation complications following conservative surgery (CS) and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with early stage breast cancer.&quot; ## [4] &quot;Treatment-related toxicity from a randomized trial of the sequencing of doxorubicin and radiation therapy in patients treated for early stage breast cancer.&quot; ## [5] &quot;Local recurrence and survival for the german centers in the targit-a (targeted intraoperative radiation therapy-alone) trial.&quot; ## [6] &quot;Sphere of Equivalence-A Novel Target Volume Concept for Intraoperative Radiotherapy Using Low-Energy X Rays.&quot; head(data_ordered[[&quot;title&quot;]][data_ordered[[&quot;group_fit&quot;]] == 2]) ## [1] &quot;Screening for wart virus infection in normal and abnormal cervices by DNA hybridisation of cervical scrapes.&quot; ## [2] &quot;Viral load of human papillomavirus and risk of CIN3 or cervical cancer.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Progressive potential of mild cervical atypia: prospective cytological, colposcopic, and virological study.&quot; ## [4] &quot;Relation between human papillomavirus type 16 and potential for progression of minor-grade cervical disease.&quot; ## [5] &quot;HPV 16 DNA in normal and malignant cervical epithelium: implications for the aetiology and behaviour of cervical neoplasia.&quot; ## [6] &quot;Final efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety analyses of a nine-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in women aged 16-26 years: a randomised, double-blind trial.&quot; "]]
